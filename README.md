# Godot-SlotMachine-Demo

Welcome to my Godot slotmachine demo!

The whole Project was built with Godot 3.2 Beta.

In this repo you can find a small slotmachine wich was built in Godot Engine. 
Mainy I used the native UI Nodes of Godot, and the new Spritesheet function!

I Also uploaded a video, where I show you how this thing works. :)
