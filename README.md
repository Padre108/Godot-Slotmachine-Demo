# Godot-Slotmachine-Demo

Welcome to my Godot slotmachine demo!

The whole project was built with Godot 3.2 Beta.

In this repo you can find a small slotmachine wich was built in Godot Engine. 
Mainy I used the native UI nodes of Godot, and the new spritesheet function!

I also uploaded a video, where I show you how this thing works. :)
